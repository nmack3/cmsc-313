**AUTHORING: NATHAN MACK - cmsc 313 - 4.16.25

**PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE: These are two different pieces of code that both accomplish the same purpose of doing basic matrix operations in both c and cpp

**FILES: 
the .cpp portion of the project is under the /code_cpp file
the .c code is under /code_c

**BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: 
gcc for .cpp files: g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra main.cpp Matrix.cpp -o matrix_cpp
run: ./matrix_cpp

gcc for .c files: gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra main.c matrix.c -o matrix_c
run: ./matrix_c

**TESTING METHODOLOGY: I just included an example like the function we were supposed to complete, implementing more should work fine.

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: i included screenshots of the run code in each version with the pdf submission
